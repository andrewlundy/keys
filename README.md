# Keys
My first indie app - a password management application built for iOS.

(This app is not complete)

------
By using Firestore to store user data, authenticate user sign in and update data in realtime on the client side - Keys is a fullstack password management product. 

The idea comes from my own struggles and that I write all of my passwords down on paper. This idea has been detrimental in my iOS development learning process as I have learned a lot of the basics from building this.
